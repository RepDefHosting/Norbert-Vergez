**Problem**: Metabolic Syndrome – Prediabetes – Diabetes (generally type 2)

**Discussion**: More than 90% of the world’s population, this includes developed countries (1.8 billion).

Ultimately, our focus is on everyone, providing solutions to minimize developing diabetes.

Since the early 1900s, global trends have shifted dramatically. Today, the emphasis is less on smoking and drinking and more on well-being, productivity, and a healthy lifestyle.

We are dedicated to developing products that enhance quality of life, grounded in molecular scientific research and clinically studied ingredients. Join us on a journey into a new beverage segment: the Productivity and Performance Category.

The “Human Being” is composed of 4 main systems/structures:

1. Bones

2. Muscles

3. Organs

4. Nerve System

The nerve system is divided into TWO segments: Central (CNS) and Peripheral (PNS)

Everyday life includes living in a polluted environment with direct impacts on our bodies:

1. We breathe polluted air.
2. We consume unhealthy food, particularly high in sugar.
3. We do not dedicate enough time to physical and mental activities, such as fitness and yoga.



These factors, both directly and indirectly, affect our organs and nervous system. It is no secret that excessive sugar consumption is a primary contributor to diabetes, as well as metabolic syndrome and prediabetes. All these elements lead to oxidative stress (OS) in the nervous system— a condition that is challenging to diagnose and treat often resulting in cell and tissue damage, and may lead to the development of chronic diseases

OS negatively affects mood, stress, sleep and performance levels as well as:

1. Aging: OS can contribute to the progressive loss of function in tissues and organs that occur with aging
2. Cancer: OS can play a role in the development of cancer.
3. Cardiovascular disease: OS can contribute to cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis.
4. Diabetes: OS can contribute to diabetes and diabetes-related microvascular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and end-stage renal disease.
5. Kidney disease: OS can play a role in the pathophysiology of both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Neurodegenerative disease: OS can play a role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. ***How can we address this challenge beyond the standard medical recommendations?***

**Solution:** The answer dates to the 1950s and has been thoroughly researched throughout the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. After decades of investigation, and through four clinical studies conducted between 1996 and 2002 by a team of doctors (several of whom are co-founders of Idrinq), the solution became clear: ***Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA)**.*

**What makes ALA effective?**\
Clinical studies from 2002 have demonstrated the following key benefits of ALA:

1. ***Enhances nerve cell and nervous system function***
2. ***Boosts cellular energy production**,* providing the body with essential energy
3. ***No adverse effects***, ensuring it is safe for human use

To date, ***ALA remains the only scientifically validated solution*** for treating impaired nerve function.

In Germany alone, over 90,000 individuals have been studied, with more than 10 million doses of ALA administered. Today, physicians in 20 of the 30 most developed countries prescribe ALA as the primary treatment for nervous system disorders.

***There is no doubt: ALA is a proven solution that improves quality of life, preserves health, and, in many cases, saves lives.***

**Innovative Advancements in ALA: A Breakthrough in Wellness Beverages**

In 2009, a team of doctors and biochemists pioneered the development of a liquid form of Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA), enhanced with L-Arginine for additional benefits. Since its inception, extensive research and development have been carried out to refine and perfect this formulation. By 2018, the first prototype – a mildly carbonated beverage – was produced and tested among a select group.

Though global challenges like COVID-19 and geopolitical events delayed progress, 2022 marked a turning point. The product was introduced to the European market, followed by the U.S. launch in 2023, primarily through test sales and sampling in large consumer groups. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with customers reporting significant improvements in their well-being, motivating us to expand into the rapidly growing market of functional beverages.

***Our product line is designed not only to enhance quality of life and improve performance but also to support nerve and muscle function.*** Unlike typical energy drinks laden with sugar or caffeine, our formulations are rooted in clinically proven ingredients. ALA, the core of our products, is a powerful antioxidant with well-documented health benefits, providing support at the cellular level.

Our range caters to a broad spectrum of consumers, from children to busy professionals. Each product is fortified with ALA, delivering essential support for overall wellness, making it an ideal choice for anyone seeking scientifically backed, health-enhancing beverages.

1. Standard Idrinq line is for general wellbeing, stress control and mental performance. Enhanced with B group vitamins 3,5,6,9.

2. For physical performance and after fitness recovery we offer boosted with L-carnitine and Vitamin C, Amino acid D.



3. For Kids – mental focus, stress relieve, increased productivity when studying and playing sports. Enhanced with L-theanine and Essential Amino Acids (EAAs).



4. For better quality of sleep and deeper nerve function during the night. Enhanced with L-Arginine and L-Theanine.



5. For sexual performance. Empowered by additional amino acid L-citrulline.

6. For those who wish to control the party performance and not get overdosed by alcohol.



**ALA: Harnessing the Body’s Natural Potential for Enhanced Longevity and Well-being**

Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA) offers a unique opportunity to tap into the body’s natural resources, cleansing and enhancing the function of the nervous system. Acting as a catalyst, ALA helps optimize nerve function, improve quality of life, and even influence longevity. It is poised to become a game-changer in the food and wellness industry. This is nature’s gift—one we must embrace and share to help empower individuals in taking control of their well-being.

In an age where longevity and anti-aging are top priorities, ALA allows us to counteract the effects of environmental pollution and stress. It supports smarter, more informed choices when it comes to health and vitality. While the science behind ALA—its chemistry and biology—can seem complex, the benefits are simple: life-enhancing and life-extending.

Each of our formulations is based on robust scientific research and clinical studies of ALA’s effectiveness in supporting nerve function, complemented by L-Arginine, which boosts muscle performance. In addition, every version is fortified with essential elements, minerals, and vitamins to target specific areas of human performance, ensuring optimal results for various needs.

Our commitment to excellence means all our products are crafted with the highest quality ingredients. While this places our offerings in a premium price segment, it begs the question: can we truly afford to cut corners when it comes to our health? Just as with natural, healthier foods, investing in your well-being is invaluable.

While the secret to infinite longevity remains elusive, making informed, health-conscious decisions can give you an extra day, week, month, or perhaps more. Extend your lifespan, and more importantly, improve the quality of your life with each choice.

We must fully utilize the gifts of nature, combined with the technological advancements and research that drive progress today. This potential is encapsulated in every can of **Idrinq**. With every sip, you experience the benefits of ALA and the smartest choice for your body, regardless of age or lifestyle. Our range of flavors ensures there’s an Idrinq product that suits your personal taste, so you can nourish yourself without limits.

***Unlock your potential** **and choose longevity with** **Idrinq***—the beverage that empowers your well-being.
